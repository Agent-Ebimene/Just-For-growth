I checked out how to connect Node js and Express to an A react Js Application.
Created a server and a basic API that sends the client side a few Data.
Used the useEffect React Method and the fetch API to get this data.
Then,the fetched result was displayed in the browser through a state variable that was set to hold the returned value.
This Youtube resource made this whole process way easier

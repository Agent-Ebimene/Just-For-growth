This error is very common during development when trying to change the state value with a function that takes the previous state value.
Whenever you use a function with the previous value as an argument, alwayys try to return the value(Whatever manipulation you have done to 
the state.
I was trying to delete an item on a click. I tried to use the filter method since mutation of state is not allowed in React but I forget 
to return a value after my operation and it led to this scary error.

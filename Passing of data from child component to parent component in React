Passing of data from parent to child components is pretty straight forward and easy to do for any React developer out there
But passing data in the opposite is always comes with it, some level of tricks and difficulties.
The following steps will be able to help out in such scenerios:
If the case here is to send some data from a form to update the global state
Write a function in the child component.
Write a function in the parent component also and pass this function as a prop to the child component.
Call this function in your child component's function.
I had to watch a Youtube video to solidify this always tricky task.

In this personal development activity, I investigated the science of creating gitignore files in projects.
Projects contain different dependencies that are fequently updated over time.Hence,there is no need to upload these dependencies to 
github as a simple npm install in the case of React or Node will add all packages that are contained in the package.json file.
I got this very relevant and applicable development concept from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mdOOgx6fEw
